# convenience
This package is a collection of functions I frequently use for data preparation.
In particular, it contains functions required for the income harmonization in the POLAR ISSP cumulation. 


It is not on Cran, so to install and update the package, run 

> `devtools::install_github("ratsupaltuf/convenience", force=T)`
