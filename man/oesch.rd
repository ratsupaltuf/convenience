\note{



For function input, we need to properly code NA in n.employees before calling function
Those who are working for family business are coded as self-employed without employees in Oesch schema
-> need to fix that as well before function call
those working for family business have no empl. anyways -> ess[emplrel==3, table(emplno)]

freq(ess$emplrel)

ess[, self.employed:=0]


ess[emplrel==2 | emplrel==3, self.employed:=1]

tail(freq(ess$emplno))

ess[, n.employees:=ifelse(is.na(emplno) | emplno>66665,0, emplno)]

freq(ess$self.employed)

summary(ess$n.employees)

Function based on isco08. If necessary, convert to isco88 to isco08 using occupar::isco88to08()
For input variables, see above.
